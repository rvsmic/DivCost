# DivCost

My second project in Swift during summer break of 2022.

Simple offline app for dividing costs between people designed for iOS devices. The idea for this app was in my head for many years and this is my first GUI based implementation. Main premise of this app is to ease the process of dividing costs among people after a social gathering - it is a variation of an advanced calculator.

## Features
* **Divisions history:** the main screen supports history of previous divisions
* **Adding divisions**
* **Editing divisions**
* **Division themes:** each division can have its own color scheme
* **Calculating each person's expenses and debts:** support of products for everybody as well as expenses among a smaller group
* **Calculating best division among all group members:** algorithm adds up all expenses and debts and calculates the best way to return money - the least amount of money transfers
